# Pricing Range Consolidation Bug Fix

## Issue Description

The consolidation of consecutive single-date pricing ranges was not working properly. Specifically:

- Adding a single date from 20260731 to 20260731 
- Then adding single date from 20260801 to 20260801
- These ranges were NOT being merged into a single consolidated range [20260731 - 20260801]

## Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the `handleAddAction` method in `PricingRangeUtilService.java`. When adding a new pricing range that doesn't overlap with any existing ranges, the method would:

1. Save the new range
2. **Return early without calling `consolidateAdjacentRanges()`**

```java
// BUGGY CODE:
if (overlappingRanges.isEmpty()) {
  // No overlaps - just add the new range
  PricingRange newRange = new PricingRange();
  // ... set properties and save
  pricingRangeService.save(newRange);
  return; // ← BUG: Early return without consolidation!
}
```

This meant that when adding consecutive dates (like July 31 and August 1), each addition had no overlaps with existing ranges, so consolidation was never triggered.

## The Fix

Modified the `handleAddAction` method to call `consolidateAdjacentRanges()` even when there are no overlapping ranges:

```java
// FIXED CODE:
if (overlappingRanges.isEmpty()) {
  // No overlaps - just add the new range
  PricingRange newRange = new PricingRange();
  // ... set properties and save
  pricingRangeService.save(newRange);
  
  // Still need to consolidate adjacent ranges even if no overlaps
  // This is critical for cases where adjacent ranges with same price are added separately
  consolidateAdjacentRanges(villaPricingSchema);
  return;
}
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that:

1. **Consecutive single dates are properly consolidated**: Adding July 31 and August 1 separately will now result in a single range [20260731 - 20260801]

2. **No regression for existing functionality**: All other consolidation scenarios continue to work as before

3. **Performance impact is minimal**: The consolidation logic is only called when needed and is already optimized

## Test Cases Added

Added comprehensive test cases to verify:

1. **Consecutive dates consolidation**: July 31 + August 1 → single range
2. **Non-consecutive dates remain separate**: July 31 + August 2 → two separate ranges  
3. **Month boundary handling**: Ensures proper consolidation across month boundaries
4. **Different price ranges remain separate**: Only same-price adjacent ranges are consolidated

## Technical Details

The consolidation logic in `consolidateAdjacentRanges()` was already correct:

- It checks if ranges are adjacent using `addDaysToDate(consolidatedEnd, 1).equals(nextRange.getStartperiod())`
- It verifies that prices are equal using `arePricesEqual()`
- It properly merges ranges by deleting individual ranges and creating consolidated ones

The only issue was that this consolidation wasn't being triggered for non-overlapping additions.

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Add a single date range: [20260731 - 20260731] with price 350.00
2. Add an adjacent single date range: [20260801 - 20260801] with price 350.00  
3. The result should be a single consolidated range: [20260731 - 20260801] with price 350.00

The fix ensures that the `consolidateAdjacentRanges()` method is called after every ADD operation, regardless of whether there were overlapping ranges or not.
